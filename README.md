The aim of the project ‘Hand landmarks detection’ is to detect and highlight the location of joints in the image of a hand. Along with the location, this projects also needs to calculate the distance been the joints (landmarks) in metric units.

The input for this project currently is an image of the back of hand with an A4 sheet paper in background. It uses open-source machine learning model to identify the key joints along with the handedness(left/right) of the hand. The output of the machine leaning model is the same image with the identified landmarks drawn on top of the image.
The project then further uses image processing to calculate the pixel distance between the joints and then convert them to metric units for real world usage and applications.
